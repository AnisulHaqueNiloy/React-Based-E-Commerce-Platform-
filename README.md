# Gadget Heaven

This application allows users to browse products, add them to their cart or wishlist, and manage their selections. The site offers a user-friendly interface with clear navigation and real-time updates. Key features include product categorization, rating, and dynamic data visualization. Under the hood, the application utilizes various React concepts and libraries to ensure a robust and efficient user experience.

## React Fundamental Concepts

List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project:

-   **State Management:** Using `useState` hook to manage dynamic data like cart items, wishlist items, and other stateful components.
-   **Effects:** Employing `useEffect` hook to perform side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to events.
-   **Routing:** Implementing `react-router-dom` for navigation between different pages of the application.
-   **Context API:** Using Context API to share data across components without prop drilling.
-   **Components:** Building reusable components using functional and class-based components.
-   **Hooks:** Leveraging custom hooks to extract reusable logic.

## Key Features

-   **Product categorization:** Organizing products into meaningful categories.
-   **Add to cart functionality:** Allowing users to add items to their shopping cart.
-   **Data visualization:** Using charts and graphs to present data in a visual format.
-   **Wishlist feature:** Enabling users to save products for later.
-   **Dynamic updates:** Real-time updates for item counts, cart contents, and wishlist items.

## Handling and Managing Data

-   **Local Storage:** Storing cart data locally in the browser's storage for persistence.
-   **Context API:** Sharing global data, such as user preferences or theme settings, across components.

## Additional Features

-   **Active navigation:** Enhancing user experience by highlighting the current page.
-   **Icon usage:** Improving the visual appeal of the website.
-   **Toast notifications:** Providing visual feedback to the user.
